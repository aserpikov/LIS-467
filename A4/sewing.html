        <h1>Sewing</h1>
        <p>Sewing is one of the oldest textile arts, and one of the most widely practiced needlecrafts in the world.
            Between hand sewing and machine sewing, sewing allows anyone to create their own clothing, accesories, homegoods,
            and more. Check out the resources below to get started with sewing or to find patterns to continue your
            sewing journey at any level!

        <h3>Hand Sewing</h3>

        <p>Hand sewing is an easy way to start off learning how to sew as it involves 
            fewer and cheaper materials than machine sewing, and builds skills with mending existing 
            items and creating small projects. Hand sewing is also useful when you do not have access
            to a sewing machine, or are working with materials that require more precision, such as beadwork.

        <p>Machine sewing is a great skill to learn if you want to make your own clothes, linens, or other fabric-based items.
            Machine sewing allows you to take on more complex projects in a shorter amount of time than hand sewing, and provides
            you with a range of settings and attachments for your machine that can make sewing a lot faster and easier. Machine
            sewing can also give your projects a more professional look.

            you can choose from. Pants are a bit more of an advanced project as getting the fit right can be tricky, but like all of Mood's
            online patterns, this project includes step-by-step instructions with images.
